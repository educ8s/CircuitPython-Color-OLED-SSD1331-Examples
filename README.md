I created some simple projects with CircuitPython to help you get started with this Color OLED display.

1. Simple Hello World project.
2. A Pong Game
3. A project that displays and animated GIF icon that was converted into a Sprite Sheeet. The gif icon was converted using this tool: <a href="https://github.com/educ8s/Python-GIF-to-Sprite-sheet">GIF to Sprite Sheet</a>
